A multi-platform security system. A camera takes continuous photos, and sends each photo to a server for firearm detection. If a firearm is detected, authorities are notified, and people can be alerted via a web-app and a geofencing app. The web-app shows all the "unsafe areas" in a map-view while the geofencing app notifies users when they enter an area that has been flagged as unsafe (flagging happens when a firearm is detected in the area). Won Best Use of Amazon Web Services at HackHarvard 2017.
